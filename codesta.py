    # text = Question

    prompt = f"""A math question is delimited by *. The Question is:  {Question}
        Give steps to create an animation for this math question. The animation represents only the question, not its solution.
        Use the following approach. First, identify the individual objects from the question. Objects are specific figures, shapes, lines, or points. Each object should have only one shape, figure, line, or point. Create separate objects for separate figures, even if figures are same or identical.
        For each object that is identified, create a separate step. In the step describe the object and give it any relevant labels. For example, the labels for a triangle might be A, B, and C for its vertices. Add labels wherever possible. For circles, label the centers. For polygons, label the vertices. For line segments, label the end points. Similarly, add labels wherever you think it could be useful in order to understand the image. Do not include relationships between different objects in these steps.
        Next, identify any steps that have more than one object. If identified, split this step into two or more separate steps so that each step has only one object. This is done even if the objects are identical or similar.
        When creating objects, be specific about the dimensions. If given in the question, use them. If not given in the question, assume dimensions intelligently. For instance, if the question involves a circle, choose a radius length that would be at par with any other information in the question.
        Next, add steps that give information about the spatial relationship between the objects. Specify criteria to meet the relationship between objects based on information given in the question. For example, rotation or translation of objects, changing lengths of objects, etc. this should be taken or inferred from the question. Identify and perform actions on one object at a time, not together, unless otherwise required by the question. For example, if multiple conditions exist in the question, perform one action on one object, and then the next action in a separate step. If specific distances are needed, convert them into standard units. For example, if it specifies a square with side 9 cm and a circle with radius 1 meter, then you convert these into a square of side 9 units and a circle of radius 100 units.
        Next, make each step specific and granular. The steps should be like an algorithm that can help the AI create the image. These steps will be used by an AI agent to create the image. Infer information from the question to make the steps precise. For example, if a question includes a 5 sided regular polygon, then you can infer that the internal angle is 108 degrees and include this in your steps to make it more precise. If you have any inferences that you are confident about, include a step for them to help create an accurate figure or to check that the figure meets the conditions inferred.. Only include inferences that you are very sure and confident about.
        Next, check each step to make sure that it represents only the information presented in the question. The steps should not include information that is part of the solution process. The steps should only reflect the question. Remove steps that are part of the solution. This includes creating additional lines, boundaries, or labels for anything that is not part of the question.
        Next, Delete any step that is adding the question text to the image, as in a text box. The image does not need the question text.
        Next, edit the previous steps so that any labels being used match the labels (if used) in the solution to this problem. Ignore any  additional information given in the solution. Only look at labels being used, and if the generated steps have anything similar, edit the labels in our steps to match the labels used in the solution. Donâ€™t add any new steps or any new information from the solution to our steps. The solution is used only for mapping labels. The solution is:
        Do not add scales to the image.
        When specific lengths or angles are mentioned in the question, they should also be explicitly mentioned in the image or animation. If lengths / angles are not mentioned in the question, do not add lengths or angles in the image. To display distances between two points, we used a dashed line, and added text beneath the dashed line to indicate the distance. the length does not need to be true, so do not alter the image based on the length. Just add the text as per information given in the question. The color of the dashed line and the text for displaying the distance should be the same.
        Return only your final steps, nothing else."""

        The instructions are a step-by-step method to create the required image.

        Instructions to create an image for the given math question are:
        Return only the Manim code, nothing else. Keep the following in mind:
        1. For all labels, set font_size to 20.
        4. Use buff=0.1 for all labels
        5. When adding text, keep the text color to be YELLOW.
        6. Note that to figure out intersections of curves, you need to write a function. There are no inbuilt functions in Manim to get the intersection points
        7. Use Create instead of 'ShowCreation'.
        8. Make sure that all attributes and functions you used adhere to the manim documentation. If they do not adhere, correct the manim code. The documentation is: {extracted_text}
        9. Include from math import sqrt
        10. If some objects are too big and do not fit in the screen dimension, you should try and scaled down all objects. This can be done by using something like 'self.play(all_objects.animate.scale(0.5), run_time=2)' where you specify the scale as per the need of the image / animation.
